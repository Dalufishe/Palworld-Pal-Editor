# Palworld Pal Editor

## What is this?

***This is a WIP Palworld pal editor, still in very early stage.***

***I've only tested this tool on my save, it may not work properly for you.***

***Always backup your save in case corruption happens.***

***Thankfully, this tool will not modify things you'd never asked for, and you can always inspect raw pal data.***

## How to use

1. Install Python 3.11+
2. Clone/Download the code
3. In the project directory, run `setup_and_run.ps1` for Windows Powershell, or `setup_and_run.sh` on Unix-like OS.

- There is also a pre-built binary for Windows.

## Why?

**Q: There is already a pal editor called PalEdit, is there any need to make another one?**

**A: I made this tool for many reasons:**

1. I made the tool for my friends who spent time playing this game with me ‚ù§.
2. For practicing my 2-year-untouched Python skills.
3. I don't want to rely on tools with no proper logging or indication of modification. I had no idea what and when my pals had been modified without looking into the code. And I had a really bad time fixing my game save due to some of the bugs caused by it, i.e. pal passive skill copying, modification saved to wrong pals, wrong maxHP, losing pal move sets, etc (but these have all been fixed since 0.6 so you can pretty confident using it I guess).
4. After I had PR'd several times fixing most of the mentioned bugs above, to PalEdit, and to MagicBear's fork, which eventually merged to the upstream, I just don't feel like contributing to that project anymore.
   1. I've done enough bug fixing, and sometimes I just felt upset about it - constant emerging of new bugs, thousands of lines of code on a single file... no kidding, I literally brought a new 4K monitor for debugging and fixing.
   2. I've never been credited for fixing those game-breaking bugs, but I'd never cared. However, the author treated me like a dumb fuck when I pointed out an obvious bug on Discord, even though I had already PR'd a fix with detailed explanations on how and why it was bugged, with video and screenshots. They just never bother checking it :/ After I convinced them that the bug was true, they fixed it slightly after a week more, and left my PR open, even though the fixes were the same, interesting.
